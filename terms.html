    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: September 23, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using the PhotyAi application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
    <p>PhotyAi allows users to upload their own photos and model photos, generating a combined image where the user's photo is styled with the model's outfit. This process utilizes Nano Banana API for image generation, managed through n8n workflows. Credits (5, 20, or 50) can be purchased to unlock features, and credits can be restored via the "Restore Purchase" option.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for the photos you upload. Do not upload content that is illegal, offensive, or violates third-party rights. PhotyAi does not store your photos after processing.</p>

    <h2>4. Purchases and Credits</h2>
    <p>Credits are consumable in-app purchases available in 5, 20, and 50 packs. All purchases are final, but you can restore credits using the "Restore Purchase" feature if needed.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content generated by PhotyAi is for personal use only. Commercial use is prohibited without prior written consent.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>PhotyAi is provided "as is." We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
